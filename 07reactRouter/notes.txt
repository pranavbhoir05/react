#first i use vite and tailwind to create this react setup
*then create seperate folder for components and hooks then create header and footer in components folder,also create header.jsx
*then create react router (npm install react-router-dom)

#whenever we install react-router we get access of link and navlink
now import link and navlink
1. we use link instead (a) tag (we use link to prevent page reloading again and again)
2. <NavLink> works like <Link> but it automatically detects when its to path matches the current URL.
3. isActive is predefined by React Router (you don’t create it).
You can rename it while destructuring:

#so we made changes in navlink whenever we go on home it will check if its active or not and will change color

*now create home component too and same copy paste code from notes as we did before
*now we'll asseble all components in app.jsx, but we face  error in this so we'll make few changes in main.jsx , even we do not need app.jsx
*in main.jsx we remove /app and directly add component reactProvide in this it require one thing which is router , we also gonna need to create router
*in main.jsx create method which is createbrowserRouter([]) which takes array inside it ,  this method come from react router
*in main.jsx , in that array we add object , where we add path but before that we miss few thing this

# the only thing i wanted from begining was header and footer should alwasy be same position, and its inner commponet supposed to change
#so i'll create seperate home commponet and same thing i'll do with contact us 

*create new file in src folder with name (layout) or instead u can do same operation in app.jsx
*now in that file rfce then in <> return header,footer 
*but i wanted to pass things dynamically so we importing outlet and also add outlet in fragments
*now in main.jsx give path / ,(/) is top level elenment , so all the nesting is happening inside of it . and elenment : <Layot/> which we already cr3eated
*now add children inside of it and just cause there are multiple values so i hade to create children and added array
