* first create folder in that create file todocontext.js, 
*in that file import usecontext and createcontext then createcontext hold in variable and directly export
*same create customhook for usecontext hold in variable directly export
*also create provider and hold in var and directly export 

*whenever we create context, in this context we'll firstly  create array by naming (todo)
*in this array we'll add properties in {id , todo message , completed}
*after that we;ll add functionality after array
1. addtodo :  we created this for adding todo's message
2.updatedTodo : we created for updating todo's value , to update value we gonna need id and todo's value which we gonna change
3.deletetod : for deleteing we only gonnna need id
4.toggleComplete : css will do work, and id is requird to make changes

#nomatter whats my compoent, ill always take value from this array which we created
*create index.js file in contexts folder and import as nessesary things
*in app.jsx add css from mdfile and also add todoprovider(to add functionality) as we created in todocontext.js 
*add value in provide (simply distructure it) 
*start creating function for each  method after that we are starting local storage functionality
#whenever my application loads , there can be possibility of my todos
#we;ll use useeffect to fetch value from local storage to insert in todos(in our usestate)
*in useeffect we'll firstly use localStorage.getItem, but just cause all value in loacal starage contain in string format so we need to convert in json 
#as long as we are in react(if we arnt in server side rendering) we can access localStorage in browoswer

#its time to create compoents (TodoForm , TodoItem, and also import file index,js)
*in todoform file creat usestate and then  we accessed addTodo function from useTodoContext which we created in todocontext file
#we ll create methodfor adding todo in form file 
#now add onsubmit in form and input need to do wiring(value and onchange)
#now move to todo items , bring update,delete,toggleComplete from useTodoContext and also import
#also add state variable (istododeditable) and whenever we change or edit we also gonna need one more state, so we create(todomsg)
#time to add functionality when we edit items
#also add functionality when toggleComplete which we have alrady wrote in app.jsx, so create functionality for toggle , make sure name diffrtent
#just review the functionality which is alrady wrinten in (return)
#now call compoents in app.jsx, so pass TodoForm in todoprovider and also TodoItems but
when it coomes to item we need to add little functionality(we'll add loop on our todos whic came from context) in that loop we'll pass prop to TodoItems and we;ll also call
#we;ll pass div in that div we'll pass id to improve performance
