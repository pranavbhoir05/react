1. Performance issue (Too many re-renders)

Every time a component re-renders:

*The component function runs again
*All its code runs again
*All child components might also re-render

If your function is heavy (loops, logic, API calls) → this wastes CPU, makes UI laggy.

So React provides optimization hooks:

*useMemo → cache values
*useCallback → cache functions

These reduce unnecessary re-renders.
