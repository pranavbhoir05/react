we are handling Contextapi, so we r creating global variable ,we'll be passing all data in that global variable
 but its react and state dont easily update  

 *create foldername Context with usercontext.js file
 #i put Context in .js because it’s logic file, it has nothing to do with UI component.
 .jsx is reserved for UI files.
 #curently we are creating user Context, there can be cartcontext , logincontext, authcontext and more
 
 *in this js file import react then add method react.createContext() then store in variable
*we will create Provider which will give access to components inside of this global variable
*create usercontextprovider.jsx file in same folder,  why jsx ?  cause we'll add components in fregments which is react component
*then imoport react and usercontext then create method and hold in variable

#as we seen outlet ,there is same concept we'll use
*now we'll add props in that method, name anything, i took (children), is same as div 
*in return(),add fregments then wrap the {children} as it is it will render

#in this children there can be any component e.g cardcomponent, dashboard. the reason we wrote children , write upcoming(future) components as it is
*in those fragment pass usercontext as we imported before, then add .provide and also give value
#we have wrap usercontext with provider but we dont know which value we are passing
*now pass prop value={} and pass user and setuser, makw sure to create usestate

#so in this props(value) u can give access of components as much as u want, as we did with user and setuser
*now go in app.jsx in return () add usercontextprovider in fregments

#u can also add provider in this file insted of adding in usercontextprovider
#now if u add any component in this fregments it will have direct access of values

*now create components folder also creating file login.jsx and profile.jsx
*in login file import usestate and usecontext hook also import usercontext
*create 2 input feild username and password and also button
*add onclick on button and create method for onclick
*we also gonna need state for username and password so create usestate

#after creating state, the question is how this state value will be control in onclick 
#we still havent done yet,so in input box add value from username and pass onchange, in that onchange pass callback and call setusername method call event listener
#same with password, just make sure to call setpassword

#the thing we wanted to learn is how we'll fetch value inside of usercontext by using usecontext
#as we used usestate hool,same we;ll use usecontext
*in that usecontext hook take object {setuser} which came from usercontextprovider
#if i want data from profile i'll use user and i wanted add data then i'll use setuser whic came from usercontextprovider's variable
*as we created function for button , add event and preventdefault to stop reloading page
* and same in that callback pass username and password in setuser() as we fetch from usercontextprovider
*same thing do with profile.jsx and return responce in div
