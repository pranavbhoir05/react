*install 2 libraries:
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
npm install react-redux

why 2 libraries are required :

reduxjs/toolkit:
    Builds and manages the Redux store.
    Defines slices, reducers, actions, async logic.
    Pure state management.
    Framework-agnostic.

react-redux:
    Connects Redux to React.
    Subscribes React components to the store.
    Provides Provider, useSelector, useDispatch.
    Triggers React re-renders.

Separation of responsibility:
    Redux Toolkit → state logic
    React-Redux → UI binding

Why both are required:
    RTK alone cannot update React components.
    React-Redux alone cannot create a Redux store.

Minimal correct mental model:
    Redux Toolkit creates the store. React-Redux makes React aware of it.

 #############################################################################

 what included (we gonna have to create): 
configureStore()
createSlice()
createAsyncThunk()
createReducer()
createAction()
createEntityAdapter()
createSelector()
_________________________________________________________________________________

#first we'll create store(global variable) then
#there is reducers,we wanna make anychanges in store,cause there are many stores in store(auth store,product store),reducers handles functionality 
#useSelector(for selecting) and useDispatch(for dispatching) we gonna have to learn nnow
#######################################################################################

*create folder with app(as u like) and create new file store.js
*import configureStore from '@reduxjs/toolkit' (which come from redux not from react-redux)
