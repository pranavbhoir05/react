✅ useLoaderData (React Router) — Short Notes
What it is:
A hook that lets you read data returned by a route’s loader.

✅ Why it's used
To fetch data before the component renders.
No useEffect, no loading flicker — data is ready immediately.

✅ Route setup
You attach a loader function to a route:

<Route
  path="/users"
  element={<Users />}
  loader={async () => {
    const res = await fetch("/api/users");
    return res.json();
  }}
/>

✅ What loader can return
JSON

Objects

Arrays

Anything (even errors if thrown)


✅ One-line summary
useLoaderData gives you the data returned by the route’s loader, so the component renders with data already loaded — no useEffect needed.
