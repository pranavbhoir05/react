Using Redux + Context API together is normal, but only if you use them for different purposes.
Here’s the direct explanation so you know if what you’re doing is correct or unnecessary.

✅ Correct Use Case: Redux + Context together
Use Redux for:

Big global state
Data from server
Cart, products, orders
Auth tokens
API caching (RTK Query)

Use Context API for:

Small UI-only state
Theme (light/dark)
Language
Sidebar open/close
Modal visibility
Page-level preferences

➜ Redux handles app logic. Context handles small UI preferences.

This is the cleanest architecture.

_______________________________________________________________

⚠️ Wrong Use Case (avoid)
Using Redux AND Context for the same state, like:

Theme in Redux + Theme in Context

Cart in Redux + Cart in Context

Auth in both

Products in both

This creates duplicate state, confusion, and bugs.

_______________________________________________________________

📌 When both exist in a project
Example of a proper setup:

Redux state :
user
cart
products
orders
notifications
wishlist

Context state :
current theme
sidebar collapsed/open
modal open/close
active tab
app language
page filters (UI-only)
_
This is ideal.

______________________________________________________________

📌 Why use both?
Because Redux is heavy for tiny UI stuff, and Context is weak for big data logic.

So both together = perfect balance.
