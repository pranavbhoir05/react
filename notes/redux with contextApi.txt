Using Redux + Context API together is normal, but only if you use them for different purposes.
Here’s the direct explanation so you know if what you’re doing is correct or unnecessary.

✅ Correct Use Case: Redux + Context together
Use Redux for:

Big global state
Data from server
Cart, products, orders
Auth tokens
API caching (RTK Query)

Use Context API for:

Small UI-only state
Theme (light/dark)
Language
Sidebar open/close
Modal visibility
Page-level preferences

➜ Redux handles app logic. Context handles small UI preferences.

This is the cleanest architecture.

_______________________________________________________________

⚠️ Wrong Use Case (avoid)
Using Redux AND Context for the same state, like:

Theme in Redux + Theme in Context

Cart in Redux + Cart in Context

Auth in both

Products in both

This creates duplicate state, confusion, and bugs.

_______________________________________________________________

📌 When both exist in a project
Example of a proper setup:

Redux state :
user
cart
products
orders
notifications
wishlist

Context state :
current theme
sidebar collapsed/open
modal open/close
active tab
app language
page filters (UI-only)
_
This is ideal.

______________________________________________________________

📌 Why use both?
Because Redux is heavy for tiny UI stuff, and Context is weak for big data logic.

So both together = perfect balance.

# Short Notes: Global State & Prop Drilling

Prop Drilling:
Passing data through multiple component levels.
Causes tight coupling and noisy code.

Context API:
Built into React.
Purpose: avoid prop drilling.
Shares values globally via Provider/Consumer.
No rules for state updates.
No built-in async or debugging.
Best for: theme, auth user, language, config.

Redux:
External library: Redux.
Purpose: manage global state with discipline.
Central store = single source of truth.
State changes only via actions → reducers.
Supports async, middleware, devtools.
Best for: complex, shared, business-critical state.

Key Difference:
Context = data delivery mechanism.
Redux = state management architecture.

Rule of Use:
Avoid drilling only → Context API.
Control and scale global state → Redux.
