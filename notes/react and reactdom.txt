React and ReactDOM are separate because they solve different problems.

    React is the core library. It defines components, hooks, state, and the reconciliation algorithm. It is platform-agnostic. It does not know or care about the DOM.

    ReactDOM is a renderer. It takes React’s virtual tree and applies it to the web DOM. It handles mounting, updates, and event delegation in the browser.

Why separation exists:

    Enables multiple render targets: web (ReactDOM), native (React Native), server (ReactDOMServer), custom renderers.

    Keeps React’s core logic independent of any platform.

    Improves maintainability and scalability of the ecosystem.

One-line summary:
React decides what should change. ReactDOM decides how those changes are applied to the browser DOM.
