What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind is a CSS shortcut library.
Normally you’d write something like:

css:    
  .container {
  position: fixed;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  bottom: 20px;
}

But with Tailwind, you just stack small words that represent each CSS rule.
Example:
html: 
    <div class="fixed flex justify-center bottom-5"></div>
    
Each word = 1 style. You combine them like LEGO.
___________________________________________________________
now, let’s decode your outer box step-by-step.

🔸w-full  :  Width = 100% of parent/container

🔸h-screen :  Height = 100% of the viewport (screen height)

🔸duration-200 :  Transition duration = 200ms for any CSS transition (like background color)

🔸 fixed
Means the box stays in place even if you scroll.
So it’s stuck to the screen, not the page.

🔸 bottom-5
Puts it a little bit above the bottom (about 20 pixels).

🔸 inset-x-0
Sets left = 0 and right = 0,
so it stretches horizontally across the screen.

🔸 flex
Turns the box into a flex container, which means its children can be easily centered or spaced out.

🔸 justify-center
Centers the inner box horizontally.

🔸 flex-wrap
Allows the inside items (buttons) to move to the next line if they don’t fit in one row. (Good for smaller screens.)

🔸 px-0
Means no side padding (padding on left/right = 0).

So — this outer box is fixed at bottom, full width, centered content.

Now, the inner box:
jsx:
    <div className='flex flex-wrap justify-center 
    gap-3 shadow-lg bg-white px-3 py-2 rounded-xl'>
(This is the white container that holds your buttons.)

| Tailwind class   | Meaning (Plain English)           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `flex`           | Use Flexbox layout                |
| `flex-wrap`      | Allow items to wrap if needed     |
| `justify-center` | Center buttons horizontally       |
| `gap-3`          | Put small space between buttons   |
| `shadow-lg`      | Add a soft shadow (floating look) |
| `bg-white`       | Make background color white       |
| `px-3`           | Add padding left/right            |
| `py-2`           | Add padding top/bottom            |
| `rounded-xl`     | Curve corners nicely              |

So this inner box is basically:
🟩 A white pill-shaped box with shadow,
📍 Sitting at the bottom center,
🎨 Containing your buttons spaced evenly.
