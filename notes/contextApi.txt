* contextApi purly associate with react, it doest exists outside the react

* Context API exists ONLY inside React
1. It is not a web API
2. Not a backend API
3. Not a browser API
4. Only a React feature for managing shared state

The list was about application interfaces used between systems (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, etc.).

Context API is not a network API. It’s a React internal state-sharing feature used inside a frontend app. It doesn’t expose endpoints, doesn’t handle HTTP, and doesn’t communicate between services—so it doesn’t belong in that category.

Context API – Quick Notes

Definition :
React feature for sharing state across components without prop drilling.

Why it exists :
To avoid passing props through multiple layers just to reach deep children.

Core Pieces
1. Context → created with createContext().
2. Provider → supplies the value to the component tree.
3. useContext() → consumes the value in any child component.

Flow : create context → wrap components with Provider → read value using useContext

Best Use Cases :
Auth user
Theme (light/dark)
Language
Cart/global UI state

When NOT to use :
Large or frequently changing state → causes many re-renders.
Complex logic → prefer Redux/Zustand/Recoil.

Pros :
Simple
No external library
Eliminates prop drilling

Cons:
Can impact performance if overused
Harder debugging than dedicated state managers

Rule of Thumb :
Small to medium shared state → Context API
Large/global dynamic state → dedicated state manager

✅ Scenario: Simple project with theme toggle
You have components:

App
 ├── Header
 ├── Home
 └── Footer
All three need the theme (light/dark) to style themselves.
____________________________________________________________________________________

❌ Without Context API (prop drilling)
You keep theme in App:

function App() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState("light");
  return <Header theme={theme} setTheme={setTheme} />;
}
But Home and Footer also need theme.

So you must do this:

App → Header (theme)
App → Home (theme)
App → Footer (theme)
But imagine Header has 3 nested components inside:

App → Header → HeaderTop → HeaderButtons
If HeaderButtons needs theme, you must drill:

Header passes theme to HeaderTop
HeaderTop passes theme to HeaderButtons
Even if Header & HeaderTop DON’T use theme at all.

This becomes messy fast.
____________________________________________________________________________________

✅ With Context API (no drilling)
You simply wrap once:

<ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
  <AppContent />
</ThemeContext.Provider>
Now ANY component can directly access theme:

const { theme } = useContext(ThemeContext);
No passing.
No drilling.
No props.
Clean.

🎯 What impact does Context API make in a small theme project?
* 1. You remove dozens of useless props
Instead of:

<Header theme={theme} setTheme={setTheme} />
<Home theme={theme} />
<Footer theme={theme} />
You write:

<Header />
<Home />
<Footer />
Code becomes cleaner immediately.

* 2. Any component can access theme instantly
Deep-level component?

const { theme } = useContext(ThemeContext);
No “prop pipeline” required.

* 3. Toggle theme from anywhere
Footer can toggle theme.
Navbar can toggle theme.
Button inside a card can toggle theme.

All using:

const { setTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);
No need to pass setTheme through 10 components.

* 4. Reusability skyrockets
Your UI components become reusable because they no longer depend on props like:

function Button({ theme }) { ... }
Instead they just read theme globally.

* 5. Code stays clean as the project grows
Today you have 3 components.
Tomorrow you have 30.

Without context: chaos.
With context: stable.
____________________________________________________________________________________

🔥 The simplest working example
* ThemeContext.js :

import { createContext } from "react";

export const ThemeContext = createContext();
____________________________________________________________________________________

* App.jsx
import { ThemeContext } from "./ThemeContext";

function App() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState("light");

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
      <Header />
      <Home />
      <Footer />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}
____________________________________________________________________________________

* Any component
const { theme, setTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);

return (
  <button onClick={() => setTheme(theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light")}>
    Toggle Theme
  </button>
);

⭐ FINAL SUPER-SIMPLE EXPLANATION
Without Context
You carry theme like a tiffin box through every house to give it to someone.

With Context
You put the tiffin on the table.
Anyone who needs it can pick it directly.
