✅ useParams (React Router) — Short Notes
What it is:
A hook that lets you read dynamic URL parameters from the current route.

✅ When do you need it?
When your route has a dynamic segment, like:

<Route path="/user/:id" element={<User />} />

Here, :id is a URL param.


✅ One-liner summary

useParams reads values from dynamic :segments in the URL so you can use them inside the component.

✅ How to use
Inside the component rendered by that route:

import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";

function User() {
  const { id } = useParams();
  return <h1>User ID: {id}</h1>;
}
Visiting:

/user/10
➡️ id = "10"
