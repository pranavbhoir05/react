JavaScript localStorage is a feature that allows web applications to store key-value pairs persistently in a user's browser, with no expiration date. The data remains available even after the browser is closed and reopened, but it is specific to the website's origin (domain, protocol, and port)

The keys and the values stored with localStorage are in the UTF-16 string format. As with objects, integer keys are automatically converted to strings.
so whenever needs we have to convert or deconvert in json format

syntax : 

localStorage.setItem("lastname", "Smith");
localStorage.getItem("lastname");
